## My questions to Copilot

Solving these challenges using AI wouldn't be that fun, would it?! So, to keep things as clear as possible, here are the questions I made to Copilot during the resolution session:

- How to ignore a certain character using regex?
- How to find all indexes of a character in a string?
- How to filter an array so it contains only unique characters?
- How to create inclusive ranges?
- How to select a character only if it's not followed by a positive or negative number using regex?
- How to combine negatives using regex?
- How to preserve the index position of the item found during a string#scan?
