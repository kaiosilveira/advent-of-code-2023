## My questions to Copilot

Solving these challenges using AI wouldn't be that fun, would it?! So, to keep things as clear as possible, here are the questions I made to Copilot during the resolution session:

- How to find the index of an element inside a range without parsing it to array?
- How to get an element inside a range via index?
- How to merge ranges in ruby?
- What's the equivalent to Math.infinity in ruby?
